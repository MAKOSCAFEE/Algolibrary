### DynamicConnectivty

  The input is a sequence of pairs of integers, where each integer represents an object of some
type and we are to interpret the pair p q as meaning  *p is connected to q.* We assume
that *is connected to* is an equivalence relation

+ QuickFindUnionFind :disappointed_relieved:
	* This is initial implementation but it runs in N squared times because every time we had to iterate through the array using *for loop*.
